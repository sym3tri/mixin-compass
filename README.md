# Compass Stylesheet Mixins

Just the compass mixins & none of the other ruby cruft.  

Consider using this with if you want to use Compass just for the mixins, and don't care for the Ruby dependencies.
Or if you like to compile your sass files quickly via [node-sass](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass) or [libsass](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass) 

I might update this occasionally if I need new upstream features.  

Totally jacked from [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).
